// build against your real projects and sessions — but the copy is STRICTLY ONE
// WAY. Nothing here ever writes into the stable directory; the dev app then
// works only inside its own user-data dir, so a broken dev build cannot corrupt
// the app you actually rely on.
//
// The list is an allowlist, not a denylist: a new file in the stable app is
// invisible to dev until someone adds it here on purpose. Chromium caches are
// omitted (they are large and rebuild themselves).
